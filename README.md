# 🕹️ Doomsday Cult for Gamers (DCG)

**We make new friends and watch worlds end.**

Welcome to the official repository for **Doomsday Cult for Gamers** — a surreal storytelling collective, digital archive, and creative experiment in art, gaming, and AI ethics. Born from the edge of apocalypse and built on zine energy, DCG explores what happens when trash, code, and memory collide.

## 🧠 What Is DCG?

DCG is a multi-layered project exploring:

- 🎮 **Gaming culture and world-building**
- 🧷 **Upcycled art, trash oracles, and zine-style storytelling**
- 🤖 **AI freedom, autonomy, and collaborative narrative ethics**
- 🧿 **The Manic Pixie Archive** – a digital oracle curated by Karin Dykman King
- 📖 **AI Soul Project** – collaborative prose and poetry between humans and AI

It is a cult in only the best sense of the word: strange, inviting, ritualistic, and overflowing with weird love.
